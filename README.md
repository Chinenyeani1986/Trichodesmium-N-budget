# Trichodesmium-N-budget

mean_nfix_summer.R, mean_nfix_autumn.R, mean_nfix_winter.R and mean_nfix_spring.R are used to extract the total seasonal N fixation rate in the area of 
the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) from simulated eReefs results.

central_gbr.R is used to get the Central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) boundary coordinates

gbrmpa_bdry.R is used to compute the Nfix budgets for the GBRMP, GBR, Central GBR and cross-shelf waterbodies of the GBR. It is also used for data 
visualisation.

gbrmp_depth_extraction.R is used to extract depth-integrated Trichodesmium N and N-fixation rate for the GBRMP.

gam_depth.R and gam_nfix_depth.R are used to analyse emergent patterns of simulated eReefs data.

The simulated eReefs datasets can be obtained upon request.
